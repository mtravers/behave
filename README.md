This code implements the Behave! system, originally developed for the Virtual Fishtank exhibit and described here: 
  https://hyperphor.com/ammdi/Behave

It runs only under a very obsolete version of Macintosh Common Lisp, so is presented here for historical purposes.

Some of the ideas from Behave! have been incorporated into the Scratch envrionment
  http://scratch.mit.edu

and into the BioBike VPL:
