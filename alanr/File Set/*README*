File:    File Set:*README*Created: Sept 25, 1995 by Gordon KotikThis folder contains a subsystem named "fileset" that providessystem build tools for automatically loading and/or recompilingthe files in an application.  This code is written and maintainedby Alan Ruttenberg of the MIT Media Lab (alanr-d@media.mit.edu).The code is copyright Alan Ruttenberg and is being used inMediaCalc project with his permission.The main feature of filesets is the LOAD-IF-NEWER function,which can automatically recompile and load only those files in an application which have changed since the versioncurrently loaded.  To load the fileset system when it is not already loaded,load the file "load-manually.lisp", and then execute  (ccl::load-if-newer "fileset")
